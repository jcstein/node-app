* `🟣 Initialize your Celestia light node`: this initializes a Celestia light node in the application's local storage
* `🟢 Start your node`: this starts the light node
* `🔴 Stop your node`: this stops the light node
* `🪙 Check your balance`: this displays the node's balance in TIA to 6 decimal places
* `📋 Account address: copy to clipboard`: this is to make it easy to use the faucet and check your balance
* `🗑️ Delete your data store`: deletes the data store for the node (use with caution)
* `🔐 Delete your key store`: deletes the key store for the node, the account `my_celes_key` (use with caution)
